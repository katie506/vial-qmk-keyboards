# 8btnswitch

This is an 8 button, 1 2-position switch to allow for a 2nd layer. It is a direct wired macropad with Vial support. No diodes. 

If you're not really into keyboards it can be hard to figure all this out with only documentation and examples, so I figured I'd post my macropads in case it helps someone else. Also, if you wire it the same as I did in the picture below, you can also just use QMK Toolbox to load the .hex file and start using the buttons.
