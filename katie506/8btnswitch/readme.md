# 8btnswitch

This is an 8 button, 1 2-position switch to allow for a 2nd layer. It is a direct wired macropad with Vial support. No diodes. 

I'm a newb - just trying to figure all this out with documentation and examples I can find online, so I figured I'd post mine in case it helps someone else.
