# 6btnknobswitch

This is a 6 button, 1 rotary encoder. It is a direct wired macropad with Vial support. No diodes. Rotary encoder is the type with its own pcb. 

I'm a newb - just trying to figure all this out with documentation and examples I can find online, so I figured I'd post mine in case it helps someone else.
